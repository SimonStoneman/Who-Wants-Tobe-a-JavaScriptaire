JavaScript Quiz with countdown timer

# Description
User need to answer the question to the quiz in the fastest time as the value on the time is the final score. If the user gets a question wrong the time is deducted 10 seconds, and if the timer runs out the game ends. In all senarios the user is then present to add their details to the highscore board which is only available per session.
